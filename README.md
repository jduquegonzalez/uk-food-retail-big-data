## Abstract

This dissertation investigates big data's role in optimising inventory management within UK food retail, examining current technologies, analysing effectiveness in reducing costs and surplus, and assessing scaling challenges across ten major retailers.

**Key findings:**
- Technology leaders achieve quantifiable benefits — £1.6bn reported cumulative savings, 190bps availability improvement — through **prescriptive/predictive** analytics
- A **complexity-efficiency trade-off** emerges: Lidl (Diagnostic, 97.9%) outperforms technology leaders through demand consolidation, whilst Aldi (Predictive, 97.7%) achieves comparable availability by combining limited-SKU simplicity with analytics investment — suggesting demand consolidation amplifies rather than substitutes for analytical capability
- A **3.9× surplus differential** between Aldi (Predictive, 0.47%) and Lidl (Diagnostic, 1.81%) demonstrates that analytics maturity and execution quality compound to produce dramatically different outcomes despite similar operational models
- Systematic barriers span technological (60% SKU inaccuracy), organisational (52% unclear use cases, 90% talent gap), and environmental dimensions (UK 3.9pp investment gap versus G7)

**Frameworks:** TOE Framework · SCOR Model · 5Vs Framework

## Quick Start

### Interactive Notebook

The fastest way to explore the research is the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebook/dissertation_summary.ipynb
```

The notebook contains a condensed dissertation narrative with figures generated by importing scripts from `src/`, and tables rendered as styled DataFrames.

### Generating Individual Figures

Each script is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# From repository root
python src/chapter1/figure_1_1_market_transformation.py
python src/chapter2/figure_2_1_analytics_adoption.py
python src/chapter4/figure_4_1_analytics_maturity_dashboard.py
python src/chapter4/figure_4_5_toe_barriers_radar.py
```

> **Note:** Some figures (1.2, 4.2, 4.4, Appendices B & C) require external data files. See `data/README.md` for source information.
